A RISC-V processor consists of two main blocks: the Controller and the Datapath.
Controller, acts as the brain of the processor, managing instruction flow through a finite state machine (FSM) and sending control signals to the Datapath.
Datapath, executes instructions by performing operations like arithmetic, logic, and memory access. It includes components such as the Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Register File, ALU, and Data Memory.
